# What is this API?

### What is this API?

This API is for creating and managing [Distributed Validators](https://docs.obol.tech/docs/int/key-concepts#distributed-validator). This API works in tandem with Obol's [Distributed Validator Launchpad](https://holesky.launchpad.obol.org), a dapp designed to allow people to authenticate their counterparties and agree to the terms of a Distributed Validator Cluster. This API will be made more easy for code-only interaction in the coming quarters with the release of the Obol-SDK.

Read more about Obol and how to use the [launchpad](https://holesky.launchpad.obol.org) on our [docs site](https://docs.obol.tech/).
